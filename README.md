============

Code of Conduct

This is a repository that manages the Code of Conduct for YAPC::NA.

Process
=======

The master branch contains what the current YAPC::NA will use for its code of
conduct. There is a proposed\_XXXX branch (currently proposed\_2014) where all
pull requests and discussion should live. TPF will determine when that branch
is closed (for submission to lawyers, etc). At that time, a proposed\_XXXY
branch will be opened. When TPF determines that the proposed wording for XXXX is
acceptable, it will be merged to master, a tag created, and the proposed\_XXXX
branch will be deleted.
