This document is for event staff and volunteers, and provides guidelines on handling violations of the code of conduct as well as harassment complaints from attendees.

## Warnings

Any event volunteer or staff member can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behavior violates the event’s code of conduct. Warnings should be reported to event organizers (phone numbers TBD) as soon as practical. The report should include:

* Identifying information about the participant (appearance, clothing, etc)
* The time you issued the warning
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

## Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although a member of the event staff or volunteers should speak to the presenter afterward. However, staff/volunteers should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say “I’m sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time” with no further explanation.

## Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by staff, volunteer, or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it.

* Identifying information about the participant (appearance, clothing, etc)
* The time you issued the warning
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

## Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

* A second offense resulting in a warning
* Continuing to harass after any “No” or “Stop” instruction
* A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
* A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
* A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)
* Venue security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

## Public statements

As a general rule, event staff and volunteers should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during or after the event.

In general, consult with other event staff and volunteers when possible but act when necessary.
